Analysis and Prediction of Auto Insurance Claims

### Introduction

In this notebook, we tackle the challenge of predicting auto insurance claims. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately predict whether a customer will file a claim over $1,000, which is crucial for insurance companies to assess risk and optimize premium pricing

Our approach involves:
1. Comprehensive data exploration and feature engineering on customer and business related features
2. Implementation and selection of various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost
3. Detailed model evaluation and feature importance interpretation using SHAP values
